👥 Multi-User Home Management Dashboard Flow
1. User Signup / Login

Each family member creates their own account.
Roles can be:

Admin (father/mother)

Member (kids, roommate, partner)

2. Family Group Creation

Admin creates a Family Group (like a WhatsApp group).
Then sends an invite link/code to other members.

Example:
Family ID: HOME123 → others join.

3. Shared Dashboard (Real-Time)

All users inside the same family group see:

Same bills

Same grocery list

Same events

Same tasks
Changes update for everyone.

4. User Permissions

You can set simple permissions:

Admin: add/edit/delete

Member: add tasks/grocery, cannot delete bills

Kids: view only

(Optional but useful)

5. Activity Tracking

Each action shows who did it:

“Milk added by Sarah”

“Electricity bill marked paid by John”

Helps track shared home activities.

6. Notifications (Optional)

All members get:

Bill due reminders

Grocery item low stock

Today’s tasks

7. Individual Personal Area

Each user can have:

My tasks

My reminders

Though everything stays inside the same family group.

⭐ Summary

Yes, multiple users can use it.
You simply create a Family Group → users join → everyone shares the same dashboard.
